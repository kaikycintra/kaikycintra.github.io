# C Programming Language

The **C programming language** is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the early 1970s. It was designed to be a portable, fast, and flexible language for implementing system software, including operating systems and compilers.

## History

C evolved from the earlier B programming language, which was developed by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs. Dennis Ritchie further developed B into the C language, incorporating features from other languages like BCPL and ALGOL. The development of C played a crucial role in the development of Unix operating system, which is largely written in C.

## Features

- **Procedural Language**: C is a procedural programming language, meaning it follows a top-down approach to program design.
- **Portability**: C programs are highly portable, allowing them to be compiled and executed on various platforms with minimal changes.
- **Efficiency**: C is known for its efficiency and close-to-hardware performance, making it suitable for system programming and embedded systems.
- **Structured Programming**: C supports structured programming constructs like functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Pointers**: One of the most powerful features of C is its support for pointers, which allow direct memory manipulation and efficient access to data structures.
- **Standard Library**: C comes with a rich standard library providing functions for various operations like input/output, string manipulation, memory allocation, and more.

## Influence

The influence of C on the field of computer science and software engineering cannot be overstated. Many modern programming languages, including C++, [Java](/wiki/Java), and [Python](/wiki/Python), have been influenced by C in terms of syntax, semantics, and design principles. C remains a widely-used language in systems programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.

## Examples

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in C:
